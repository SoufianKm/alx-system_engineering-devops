lizabeth it is in vain you say
ove not"—thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
n vain those words from thee or L.E.L.
antippe's talents had enforced so well:
h! if that language from thy heart arise,
reath it less gently forth—and veil thine eyes.
ndymion, recollect, when Luna tried
o cure his love—was cured of all beside—
is follie—pride—and passion—for he died.
