# Web Infrastructure Design

## Overview

In this project, we delve into the realm of web infrastructure design, encompassing various critical components such as DNS, monitoring, web servers, network basics, load balancers, and servers. The aim is to create a robust and scalable infrastructure that ensures reliability, performance, and security for web applications.

## Concepts Covered

- **DNS**: Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling users to access websites using human-readable names.
- **Monitoring**: Monitoring involves tracking and analyzing system performance and availability to detect and address issues promptly.
- **Web Server**: Web servers are software applications that handle HTTP requests from clients, serving web content to users.
- **Network Basics**: Understanding network basics is crucial for designing and managing network infrastructure efficiently.
- **Load Balancer**: Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization and improve reliability.
- **Server**: Servers host web applications and data, providing resources and services to clients over a network.
