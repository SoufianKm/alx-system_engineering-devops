# Background Context

As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, proficiency in interacting with every layer of the stack is essential. One effective way to gauge this proficiency is by asking engineers to explain how a software system functions. They can opt for a broad overview of the flow or delve deep into specific areas. 

In this exercise, we aim to sharpen our understanding of the infrastructure side of software systems, focusing on aspects such as network architecture, server management, and security protocols.
