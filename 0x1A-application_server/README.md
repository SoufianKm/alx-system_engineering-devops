# Application Server Integration

## Overview

In this project, we aim to enhance our web infrastructure by introducing an application server to complement Nginx. While Nginx serves static content efficiently, an application server is essential for handling dynamic content. We will seamlessly integrate the application server with Nginx and configure it to serve our Airbnb clone project.

## Key Steps

1. **Understanding the Role of Application Server:** Before diving into implementation, it's crucial to grasp the distinction between a web server and an application server. While Nginx excels at serving static content, an application server is tailored for executing dynamic code. This project will focus on leveraging the strengths of both components to create a robust web infrastructure.

2. **Resource Utilization:** We will refer to resources such as articles and documentation to gain insights into best practices for integrating an application server with Nginx. Understanding concepts like serving Flask applications with Gunicorn and Nginx will be pivotal in our implementation.

3. **Implementation:** We will ensure that the prerequisites for our project are met, including completing task #3 of the SSH project for web-01, installing the net-tools package, and cloning the AirBnB_clone_v2 repository on our web-01 server.

4. **Configuration:** The Flask application will be configured to serve content from the route /airbnb-onepage/ on port 5000. It's imperative that the Flask application object is named app to facilitate seamless execution and verification.

## Conclusion

By integrating an application server into our web infrastructure, we aim to enhance the performance and functionality of our Airbnb clone project. This project represents a crucial step forward in building a robust and scalable web architecture.
