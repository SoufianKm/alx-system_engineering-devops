# Networking Basics #0

## Overview

This project provides an introduction to essential networking concepts for beginners.

## OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. It is organized as follows:

1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

## LAN (Local Area Network)

- **What is it:** A network that is limited to a small geographic area.
- **Typical usage:** Connecting computers, printers, and other devices within a single location (e.g., office, home).
- **Typical geographical size:** Within a building or campus.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)

- **What is it:** A network that covers a broad area, often across cities, countries, or continents.
- **Typical usage:** Connecting LANs over long distances.
- **Typical geographical size:** Can span a city, country, or even globally.

## Internet

- **What is it:** A global network connecting millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks.
  
## IP Address

- **What is an IP address:** A numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network.
- **Types:** IPv4 and IPv6.

## Localhost

- **What is localhost:** A hostname that refers to the current device used to access the network services.
  
## Subnet

- **What is a subnet:** A logical subdivision of an IP network.

## IPv6

- **Why IPv6 was created:** To address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.

## TCP/UDP

- **Data Transfer Protocols:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
- **Difference between TCP and UDP:** TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication, while UDP is faster but unreliable.
  
## Port

- **What is a port:** A communication endpoint in software.
- **Memorize Port Numbers:**
  - SSH: 22
  - HTTP: 80
  - HTTPS: 443

## Network Connectivity Check

- **Tool/Protocol:** ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) commonly used by the Ping tool to check if a device is connected to a network.
