# Web Server

## Overview
A web server is software that runs on a computer and serves web content to users. It handles requests from web browsers, like Chrome or Firefox, and sends back the requested web pages. Web servers use protocols like HTTP and HTTPS to communicate securely. They're essential for hosting websites, web apps, and online services. Popular web server software includes Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS. They handle tasks like serving static files, executing server-side scripts, and managing security features. Overall, web servers play a vital role in delivering content over the internet.
