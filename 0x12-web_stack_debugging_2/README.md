# Web Stack Debugging #2

In Linux systems, the user "root" is considered the superuser, with the ability to execute any command and perform any action on the system. While this grants extensive control over the system, it also comes with significant risks. A common practice in Linux administration is to avoid logging in directly as the root user to prevent accidental execution of destructive commands.

For instance, mistakenly running a command like `rm -rf /` as the root user can result in catastrophic data loss with no means of recovery. Therefore, it is advisable to operate as a privileged user instead, retaining the ability to execute specific commands that require elevated privileges.

In the context of this project, the containers provided, as well as the checker, run under the root user by default. This enables them to execute commands with elevated permissions and perform tasks that may otherwise be restricted.

To debug and troubleshoot issues within the web stack effectively, it's essential to understand how to leverage the root user privileges responsibly. By doing so, you can diagnose and resolve issues efficiently while minimizing the risk of unintended consequences.
